        <h2>What is Wildveil?</h2>
        <p><em>Wildveil</em> is an online 2D fantasy breeding and exploration game where players raise, battle, and trade elemental foxes in a world shaped by the forces of nature. With a unique elemental system, seasons that impact gameplay, and a vast world to uncover, players must strategize to build the strongest pack. Breed foxes to pass down rare traits and mutations, explore ever-changing landscapes for hidden treasures, and compete for dominance in battles for powerful Fox-shards. Will you master the elements or fall to the wild?</p>
